                <p>The VIP redesign was a design challenge issued by innovations consultants associated with the 
                  Rigshospital&rsquo;s pediactric care unit, and was related to a course at the IT-university revolving around Service design. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The challenge was to identify a solution, which enabled an increased use of an internal digital document system named VIP. 
                  The VIP system is utilized by nurses and other medical staff at danish hospitals to look up procedures and protocols for practice,
                  which meant a lack of usage could potentially lead to a reduction of patient care quality.                   
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  By identifying the causes for the lack of usage, we were able to propose a designed solution which would increase the VIP usage
                  and ultimately creating a better experience for both the nurses everyday life as well as the patients.

              the problem area</h3>
            <p>After gaining an understanding the initial design challenge, we conducted interviews with the administrative staff
              of the hospital as well as field observations, which involved following nurses in their daily work. This resulted in 
              identifying three problem areas: Accesibility, Readability and Credibility.

                designing for.

              <p>Having gained an understanding for who we are designing for and the surrounding context, a barrier analysis combined
                with &rsquo;&rsquo;How might we&rsquo;&rsquo; questions were utilised. Subsequently
               ideas were sketched and selected via a 10 plus 10 idea generation methodology.

              <p>The final concept resulted in the following 6 design suggestions: 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>1.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;Suggestions within the Healthcare Platform 
                <br>
                <b>2.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;Suggestions within the VIP system
                <br>
                <b>3.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;Consistency in VIP documents 
                <br>
                <b>4.</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;A short and elaborated version of a VIP document 
                <br>
                <b>5.</b>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback mechanism within the VIP system 
                <br>
                <b>6.</b>  &nbsp;&nbsp;Awareness regarding updated VIP documents 
                <br>
                <br>
                Adapting and implementing these suggestions into the VIP system, the challenges of Accesibility, Readability and Credibility
                should potentially be tackled. This would ultimately enable better patient care through an improved VIP system usage 
                in the everyday practice of the nurses. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The illustrations below are my own intepretation of how some of the design suggestions could be designed in practice 
                as well as a general face-lift of the VIP platform.
