                <p>Futurenow is a financial service concept designed as part of my master thesis project in collaboration with 
                  Danske Bank Group&rsquo;s Customer Engagement department. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The challenge was to design a financial service which could potentially ease negative feelings associated with
                  unexpected expenses for young adults, as this target group is often impacted by expenses they either has 
                  forgotten or has not accounted for due to a relative low liquidity. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The project was developed with two other fantastic individuals from my univeristy. Scroll down to see a brief overview 
                  of the design process.

              client and context</h3>
            <p>In order to gain a better understanding of who we are designing for, we took a field trip to the 
              local island where the carpenter operates and was shown several of his work, whilest he explains about his
              field of work.

              <p>Looking at the field trip and interview data, sketches was drawn to iterate on the different ways the website 
                could represent the key functionality needed for the carpenter. Subsequently, these sketches were digitally wireframed.

              <p>These wireframes were then utilised as the foundation for conducting a usability test (Think aloud test) to 
                determine how well potential users would navigate the website.

                -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">Final </span> concept</h3>
              <p>The final concept is a service concept, which is placed within the Mobile Bank. With the flick of switch the user can 
                switch to a <i>future view</i> which allows them to see their bank accounts balance a week, month and a year ahead. 
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition, the user can see what attributes to said account balance, which allows the user to not only be reminded of 
                unforseen expenses, but also gain an understanding of what constitutes their economy. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Lastly, the concept will also generate <i>insights</i>, which informs the user on various economic subject relevant 
                to their situation. 
                <br>
                <br>

                By allowing users to gain insights onto their economic situation and the different components consituting it, 
                the service concept should hopefully ease the negative feelings associated with unexpeced expenses through foresight.
