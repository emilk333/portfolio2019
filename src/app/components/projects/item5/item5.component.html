                <p>The Carpenter on Orø, was a project which revolved around designing a website for a local carpenter. The project
                  was developed as part of a university course &rsquo;&rsquo;Designing Digital Platforms&rsquo;&rsquo;. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The challenge was simply to design a website for person or company, while demonstrating basic UX, UI and web 
                  development competences. This means the needs of potential customers for the carpenter and the carpenter himself 
                  was identified and translated to website functionality through evocative sketching and usability testing. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The project was developed with three other individuals enrolled in the course. Scroll down to see a brief overview 
                  of the design process.

              client and context</h3>
            <p>In order to gain a better understanding of who we are designing for, we took a field trip to the 
              local island where the carpenter operates and was shown several of his work, whilst he explains about his
              field of work.

              <p>Looking at the field trip and interview data, sketches was drawn to iterate on the different ways the website 
                could represent the key functionality needed for the carpenter. Subsequently, these sketches were digitally wireframed.

              <p>These wireframes were then utilised as the foundation for conducting a usability test (Think aloud test) to 
                determine how well potential users would navigate the website.

                -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">Final </span> concept</h3>
              <p>The research showed that the carpenter believed it was important he could show of his work on his website, since
                he was highly specialized in certain type of carpentry. In conjunction with the potential users expressing the primary 
                need being able to quickly contact the carpenter and that the carpenter had a high level of trust, the website was 
                designed around these principles. 

                The images below show examples of the final website concept.
